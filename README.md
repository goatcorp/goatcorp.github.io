## Why?

The original FFXIV launcher is slow and cannot save your password. This project aims to fix that and add some QoL features to the game, such as:

* Auto-login
* Fast patching
* Discord Rich Presence
* Fast in-game market board price checks
* Chat filtering
* Chat bridge to Discord
* Discord notifications for duties, retainer sales, etc.

## How to install the launcher

[Download the latest "Setup.exe" from the releases](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher/releases/latest) page and run it. XIVLauncher will start and will be installed to your start menu.
To uninstall, you can use the Windows Programs & Apps menu or right click XIVLauncher in your start menu.

⚠ <b>Attention!</b> If you receive errors during the installation or if the launcher doesn't work correctly, make sure to <b>check your antivirus</b> first and disable it for XIVLauncher. Many commercial antivirus programs detect XIVLauncher as a false positive. You can check for yourself on VirusTotal. If you need any help with this, please [check our FAQ](https://goatcorp.github.io/faq/xl_troubleshooting#q-how-do-i-whitelist-xivlauncher-and-dalamud-so-my-antivirus-leaves-them-alone) or join our Discord channel.

## On Steam Deck and Desktop Linux
XIVLauncher now has a native Linux version that works on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux - no more messing around with scripts and command lines, just a few easy steps to install the game and add it to Steam, with a wine version especially tuned to XIV.

## How to install plugins
XIVLauncher supports the installation of __plugins/addons__ made by __third-party developers__ in-game.
Open the system menu in-game by pressing escape, and then select "Dalamud Plugins" from there. You can also use the ``/xlplugins`` command in chat.<br>If the command is not found, or the options don't show up, make sure that the in-game addon is enabled in the launcher settings.

### Is this cheating?

We don't think so - our official guideline for plugins on this launcher is this:<br>

Make sure that your plugin does not directly interact with the game servers in a way that is...
<br>a) *outside of specification*, as in allowing the player to do things or submit data to the server that would not be possible by normal means or by a normal player on PC or PS4.
<br>b) *automatic*, as in polling data or making requests without direct interaction from the user which could create unwanted load on the server or give away that XIVLauncher is being used.
<br>c) *circumvent paywalls*, as in any attempts to bypass restrictions that require purchase to be lifted such as enabling access to mog station emotes.

We feel like that this offers developers the __freedom to improve the game's functionality__ in ways that SE can't, while officially disallowing plugins that can give __unfair advantages over players on other platforms__.
